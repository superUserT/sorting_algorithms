# Sorting Algorithms and Big O Analysis

This project, titled "0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O,". The primary goal of this project is to gain a deep understanding of various sorting algorithms and the Big O notation for analyzing algorithm time complexity.
Project Overview

We will explore and implement several sorting algorithms in the C programming language. These sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort. For each algorithm, we will provide a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order.

In addition to implementing the sorting algorithms, we will analyze their time complexity using Big O notation. This analysis will help us understand how these algorithms perform in different scenarios.

# Provided Resources

For this project, the following resources are provided:

    print_array and print_list functions for printing arrays and linked lists, respectively.
    A listint_t data structure for doubly linked lists.

# Big O Analysis

Throughout the project, we will analyze the time complexity of the sorting algorithms in terms of Big O notation. We will provide these analyses for each algorithm, considering their best-case, average-case, and worst-case scenarios.

# Testing

To test the sorting algorithms with large sets of random integers, you can use external resources like [Random.org].
